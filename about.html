            <p align="right-center" >  I am  Dharshana, hard working, reliable and excellent time keeper. 
                I am a bright and receptive person, able to communicate well with people at all levels. 
                I am good at working using my own initiative and I am flexible in my approach to work duties. 
                I have a good sense of humour and a pleasant approach. </p>
                
                <p align="right-center"> Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. 
                    Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and 
                    software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.</p>

                    <p align="right-center">Computer science focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems.
                         It involves working with mathematical models, data analysis and security, algorithms,
                          and computational theory. Computer scientists define the computational principles that
                           are the basis of all software</p>
